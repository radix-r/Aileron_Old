# Aileron Proposal

## Overview

Ale-er-on

"Ace Combat meets Galaga"

I like the mini map and weapons display in ace combat

Like aerofighters in terms of graphical complexity but with the ability to turn and fly around a map instead of being locked into a single directional scroller

I like the pseudo 3d flight in Dragonball Z: Leagacy of Goku 2. Maybe with the camera angled down more so that the horizon isnt shown. Replace Piccolo with a fighter jet, throw in some things to shoot at, and add mountains/buildings/enemies to crash into then we'll have exactly what im looking for
